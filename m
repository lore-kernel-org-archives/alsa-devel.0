The patch

   ASoC: dapm: fix out-of-bounds accesses to DAPM lookup tables

has been applied to the asoc tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/sound.git 

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: dapm: fix out-of-bounds accesses to DAPM lookup tables

KASAN reports and additional traces point to out-of-bounds accesses to
the dapm_up_seq and dapm_down_seq lookup tables. The indices used are
larger than the array definition.

Fix by adding missing entries for the new widget types in these two
lookup tables, and align them with PGA values.

Also the sequences for the following widgets were not defined. Since
their values defaulted to zero, assign them explicitly

 snd_soc_dapm_input
 snd_soc_dapm_output
 snd_soc_dapm_vmid
 snd_soc_dapm_siggen
 snd_soc_dapm_sink

Fixes: 8a70b4544ef4 ('ASoC: dapm: Add new widget type for constructing DAPM graphs on DSPs.').
