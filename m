Summary:                    CA0106 with Soundblaster 24-bit live does not allow
recording
Description: 
When I use the line in on the card, it will not capture unless i crank up
the mixer to near peak, and then its garbled and distorted sound, my
capture is up all the way and i know its not a dumb mistake of mine

The development version compiles find without errors. You must be doing
something wrong.
One point to note when compiling alsa-driver, is that it has to be
compiled with the same version of GCC as the rest of the kernel. You might
have compiled the kernel and upgraded GCC since.
So, if you have not compiled the kernel yourself and installed that
version, alsa-driver is unlikely to compile.
So, I think a better test would be to compile and install your own kernel,
leaving all kernel sound options as MODULES. The reboot into the new
kernel and then compile alsa-driver.

I got it to compile i had to go into alsa-kernel/pci/ac97/ac97_bus.c and
delete the first include and insert #include <sound/driver.h> or
something..

solved here..
