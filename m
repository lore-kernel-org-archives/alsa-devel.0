nforce2 built in sound on an a7n8x-e deluxe motherboard
am also experiencing this issue on 2.6.10. Very frustrating, its a
showstopper on migration from windows to linux. Will attach
/etc/asound.state and /proc/asound/card0/codec97#0/* files tonight.

I think that my issue report # 902 describes the same problem, although I
have examined that it's the rear socket's channel second not working
regardless of mixer settings. Could anyone check if it's so?
