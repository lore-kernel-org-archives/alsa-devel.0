Summary:                    ALSA > 1.0.5a does not load, failed with error -16
Description: 
I'm having some problems with alsa since 1.0.6a. Previously I just had the
later versions masked, but now various kde packages require the latest
alsa, so I'm having to tackle it now. ALSA seems to start normally,
however I get this error in dmesg: 
EMU10K1X: probe of 0000:00:09.0 failed with error -16. 

I also get this error when running alsamixer: 
alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such device 

And similar ones in other alsa programs. 

Again, 1.0.5a runs fine, 1.0.6a and above do not. I've taken a look at the
code and it seems that the error is vaguely interrupt related, but I could
not find the code that produces error -16. I've swapped interrupts around
and disabled non-essential devices (usb, serial, parallel ports, removed
network cards and sound cards - although that last one proved slightly
less than helpful :) I've changed from having my bios manage irq's to
having the OS handle them with zero success. 

I've looked around for that error code in google for the last few weeks -
since the release of 1.0.6a with limited success. Nothing relevant to my
situation. 

Important configs and error messages:
$ lspci -v |grep audio -A4

(It is an actual EMU10k1X and not the Dell bastardized version)

$ /etc/init.d/alsasound start; dmesg |tail -n1

If anyone needs any other config information, please let me know. Again,
it works perfectly fine in 1.0.5a, the problems only appear in later
versions.

Just tried changing line 1277 of /alsa-kernel/pci/emu10k1/emu10k1x.c from
:
#define EMU10K1X_MIDI_MODE_OUTPUT       (1<<1)
to:
#define EMU10K1X_MIDI_MODE_OUTPUT       (1<<0)

and recompiling/reinstalling with no change in the error. I'm not sure if
that is what you wanted me to disable or not, but now that I know where I
should be looking, I'll go through the file and see if there is anything
else I could try.

Try commenting out the following lines in the probe function like this:

/*
	if ((err = snd_emu10k1x_midi(chip)) < 0) {
		snd_card_free(card);
		return err;
	}
*/

Also, try putting some printf() calls after each block before that one so
that we can track where it failed. I will add a better error handling
soon.
