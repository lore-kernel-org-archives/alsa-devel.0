Summary:                    problem with alsa-driver and asus m5a notebook
Description: 
I use gentoo-linux on an asus m5a notebook. Installation of alsa-driver
works without any error messages. xmms, aplay etc. play files, but i can't
hear anything. alsa-mixer shows me all the mixer-controls. I didn't forget
to unmute, and with windows sound is working fine - so i think there is a
problem with the alsa-driver and this notebook (on other notebooks with
the same sound-chip alsa is working).

I tried the following, always with the same results:
- compile alsa in the kernel
- compile alsa as kernel modules
- emerge alsa-driver (version 1.0.9-rc3 - 1.0.9-rc4 is not in portage
yet)
- compile alsa-driver manually (version 1.0.9-rc4)

Everything seems to work fine, but i can't hear anything, so maybe this is
a bug in the alsa-driver.
Would be great if somebody could tell me how i get alsa working on my
notebook  ;-)

Greetz,
thomas
