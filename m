Summary:                    No Sound with snd-hda-intel driver Asus P5VDC-MX
Description: 
Kernel is up-to-date Xen kernel.

Initial install did not recognize the sound on an ASUS P5VDC-MX
motherboard.
Motherboard has southbridge VIA VT8251. CODEC is Realtek ACL653 AC'97 6
channel
Audio. Tried the updated drivers in 002404, but was unsuccessful. Also
tried
drivers on VIA site and Realltek site. The last couple of tries show no
errors
in compiling, make, etc. However, as I am just above novice in
understanding
everything about Linux, this has thrown me for a loop.

Despite this PCI/whatever issue, the fact is that the sound is not working.
Maybe this is all related to the vt8251 chipset.

"This 05:08:0 and 05:09:0 was not seen with the default "PCI access
mode"=ANY and PCIx ON.I use Gentoo kernel gentoo-sources-2.15-r8 (x86), I
hope this can help."

So if you boot with the default settings lspci shows no sound cards at
all?

This is a kernel or BIOS issue - there's nothing ALSA can do if the sound
card doesn't appear on the bus.

What sound card is this thing supposed to have?  I can't believe you both
have the same board but lspci is showing three different soundcards?
