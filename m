Summary:                    ALSA > 1.0.5a does not load, failed with error -16
Description: 
I'm having some problems with alsa since 1.0.6a. Previously I just had the
later versions masked, but now various kde packages require the latest
alsa, so I'm having to tackle it now. ALSA seems to start normally,
however I get this error in dmesg: 
EMU10K1X: probe of 0000:00:09.0 failed with error -16. 

I also get this error when running alsamixer: 
alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such device 

And similar ones in other alsa programs. 

Again, 1.0.5a runs fine, 1.0.6a and above do not. I've taken a look at the
code and it seems that the error is vaguely interrupt related, but I could
not find the code that produces error -16. I've swapped interrupts around
and disabled non-essential devices (usb, serial, parallel ports, removed
network cards and sound cards - although that last one proved slightly
less than helpful :) I've changed from having my bios manage irq's to
having the OS handle them with zero success. 

I've looked around for that error code in google for the last few weeks -
since the release of 1.0.6a with limited success. Nothing relevant to my
situation. 

Important configs and error messages:
$ lspci -v |grep audio -A4

        Subsystem: Creative Labs: Unknown device 1003

(It is an actual EMU10k1X and not the Dell bastardized version)

$ /etc/init.d/alsasound start; dmesg |tail -n1

If anyone needs any other config information, please let me know. Again,
it works perfectly fine in 1.0.5a, the problems only appear in later
versions.

Not that but any other error messages from the driver?

I am wondering if this is related to the MIDI code. Can you compile the
code and add some printk() calls to see which part of the probe method is
failing?

You can also try to comment out the part that initializes the MIDI support
and see if that is the source of the problem.
