I was able to test sound-unstable this evening (reporting a kernel version
of 3.8.0-rc7+).  I passed "model=fujitsu-jwse" as instructed.  The
"Headphone Mic" mode switch influences the headphone jack when it's
configured as an input as I expect is the intent.  The speaker still works
and the speaker/headphone controls behave as expected.  In short there
appear to be no regressions in these respects.

It took me a while to work out that the headphone jack is only switched to
input mode when a capture setting has it selected.

The "Mic Jack Mode" seems to affect the bias applied to the mic/line-in jack
in the expected way.

Selecting the "Headphone mic" as an input source automatically switched the
"Headphone mic mode" to "Mic 80pc".  However, as far as I could tell
switching between "Mic 80pc", "Mic 50pc" and "Line in" did not affect the
bias voltage presented to the output.  I will check with a multimeter and
compare with earlier kernels to determine whether this is significant. 
Never-the-less, with "headphone mic" as an input sourse, signals were
recordable via this jack.

I noticed that in this mode it was possible to switch "headphone mic mode"
to "Headphone" and "Line out".  Doing this flicked the jack back to output
mode, and from here it was impossible to re-select and input mode until the
capture source was toggled back to "headphone mic".  I expect this is one of
the things you eluded to when you said the patch isn't complete.

I noticed the existence of a "Line jack mode" control.  I can't detect this
control doing anything.  /proc/asound/card0/codec#0 seems to indicate that
this might be a phantom jack, so perhaps this is the expected behaviour.

The "Headphone mic" volume and mute controls don't appear to do anything.

I've included output from /proc/asound/card0/codec#0 at the end of this post
in case it helps.

Both capture sources seem to operate correctly and independently as
expected.

>From a usability point of view, I think it would be best to have the mode of
the jack controlled solely by the "Headphone mic mode control".  Having to
first select this as a record source is a little counter-intuitive.  It
means that the headphone mic jack could be selected as a source when it's in
output mode, but to me it makes more sense that the control marked "mode"
had full control over the jack mode.

All in all I think this is a great start.  Are you still planning on further
work with this code or should I dive in and see what I can make of it? 
Also, is the activation via some "model=" thing intended to be permanent?

It's a minor thing, but doing this from inside the directory containing
a clone of sound-unstable gave this:

  fatal: Couldn't find remote ref v3.8
