Summary:                    MSI K8N's SB Live 24 bit, no sound from line-in
Description: 
I have a MSI K8N Platinum motherboard that has a SBLive! 24 bit
integrated.
(Un)fortunatelly this motherboard provide two different jacks for Mic and
Line-In instead of one single jack like the pci version of the sb live 24
bit.

With this card I cannot hear any sound that come from line-in.
For Example I have a tv card, its output audio go into line-in: result is
I cannot hear nothing from the tv, I can only see channels without audio.

The "Capture feedback into playback" in the mixer change the mic's
volume.
There is nothing that change line-in's volume.

You might have an older version of the kernel driver.
Please post the output of: http://alsa.opensrc.org/TroubleShooting
Do Questions 1,2,3 and 4 and post the output here.

If you find that you do not have the latest alsa-driver, please try to
upgrade to it.

Please note that Line-in has never ever worked for your motherboard based
sound card in Linux, due to lack of enough information to implement it.
So, it is not really a bug, but instead a feature that we don't know how
to implement yet.
