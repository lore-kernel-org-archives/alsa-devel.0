Summary:                    Aureon 7.1 Universe speakers in incorrect order when
doing a speaker-test
Description: 
I use my Aureon 7.1 Universe with a TerraTec HomeAreon TXR 884 7.1 speaker
set.

I've connected the outputs of the soundard to those of the subwoofer
which
itself connects the small speakers the following way:

Soundcard -------------- Subwoofer --- Small Speakers
Out Front <---------+--> In FL <-----> Front Left Speaker
                    \--> In FR <-----> Font Right Speaker
Out Rear <----------+--> In SL <-----> Side Left Speaker
                    \--> In SR <-----> Side Right Speaker
Out Center/Subwoofer <-> In C <------> Center Speaker
                      \> In Subwoofer
Out Back Surround <----> In BL <-----> Back Left Speaker
                    \--> In BR <-----> Back Right Speaker

You might have a look at soundcard manual page 8
(http://supportuk.terratec.net/modules.php?op=modload&name=Downloads&file=index&req=getit&lid=574)
and speaker manual page 12
(http://supportuk.terratec.net/modules.php?op=modload&name=Downloads&file=index&req=getit&lid=724)
My speakers are placed in my room in a configuration as the 7.1 shown on
page 12
in the speaker manual.

As you note the connection from rear to side is a little bit strange (at
least I
thought so,...) but this seems to be correct, because when I use the
windows
mixer supplied by TerraTec itself, there is a surround test included which
shows
the position of the 8 speakers and let me put the indiviually on and off
and
this leads always to the correct position.

The problem now: I tried the same as under Windows unter Linux with the
speaker-test tool.
I called it via speaker-test -t wav -c 8 and the following came out:
What wav file was played ----- in which speaker position the wav file was
played
"Front Left" ----------------- Front Left Speaker  (correct)
"Front Center" --------------- Center Speaker      (correct)
"Front Right" ---------------- Front Right Speaker (correct)
"Side Right" ----------------- Back Right Speaker  (probably wrong!)
"Rear Right" ----------------- Side Right Speaker  (probably wrong!)
"Rear Left" ------------------ Side Left Speaker  (probably wrong!)
"Side Left" ------------------ Back Left Speaker  (probably wrong!)
"LFE" ------------------------ Subwoofer (correct)

No one could think that I should just switch the speaker cables but that
can't
be a proper solution (not only because this would break settings in the
original
Windows driver (which I only use for Upgrading my Plextor drive firmware
;) ).
I think the configuration of the surround for the Aureon 7.1 Universe has
here
some mistake, hasn't it?

It seem that "Aureon71Universe" is too long

I've already noted that when playing around with mplayer,.. but found no
solution for this? Any ideas or further data you would need from me?
