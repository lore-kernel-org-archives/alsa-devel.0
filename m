Summary:                    Sounc card is mute
Description: 
I have a Turtle Beach Santa Cruz. It worked perfectly with SuSE Linux 9.0
and still works perfectly under Windows XP. I "upgraded" to SuSE 9.2 and
the sound card is inoperative, mute, lifeless, sound-free. The only advice
I got from SuSE support was that I shouldn't have skipped from 9.0 to 9.2
without going thgrough 9.1 on the way. That sounds like pretty stupid
advice.
I have spent weeks twiddling with settings  recommended by member sof the
alsa users group, to no avail.

Remove /etc/asound.state once, and run alsaconf script.

I did remove /etc/asound.state, ran alsaconf. No joy, just silence.
