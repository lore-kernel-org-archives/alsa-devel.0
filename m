Subject: [PATCH] soundwire: Don't build sound.o without CONFIG_ACPI

clang warns when CONFIG_ACPI is unset:

../drivers/soundwire/slave.c:16:12: warning: unused function
'sdw_slave_add' [-Wunused-function]
static int sdw_slave_add(struct sdw_bus *bus,
           ^
1 warning generated.

Before commit 8676b3ca4673 ("soundwire: fix regmap dependencies and
align with other serial links"), this code would only be compiled when
ACPI was set because it was only selected by SOUNDWIRE_INTEL, which
depends on ACPI.

Now, this code can be compiled without CONFIG_ACPI, which causes the
above warning. The IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_ACPI) guard could be moved to avoid
compiling the function; however, slave.c only contains three functions,
two of which are static. Only compile slave.o when CONFIG_ACPI is set,
where it will actually be used. bus.h contains a stub for
sdw_acpi_find_slaves so there will be no issues with an undefined
function.

This has been build tested with CONFIG_ACPI set and unset in combination
with CONFIG_SOUNDWIRE unset, built in, and a module.
