Summary:                    compiles, but no sound comes out
Description: 
This is a plain vanilla kernel 2.6.6, which uses ALSA 1.0.4.

The kernel compiles fine, the snd_powermac module loads without any error,
but no sound comes up.

Running alsamixer gives me a mixer screen where none of the sliders can be
moved.

pochini:  I tried every slider in amixer; they all refuse to move.

rlrevell:  Absolutely every PowerMac chipset's ALSA support is broken in
one way or another; it's *not* just Burgundy. Some chipsets have
everything except the console bell working, others everything except sound
input, others have the separate volume for the built-in speakers (as
opposed to master volume) broken, etc. Someone had started sending info
about what works and what doesn't to the Debian PPC mailing list (see
http://lists.debian.org/debian-powerpc/ for the archive). Look for a
thread whose Subject was "list of PowerMac sound hardware TO-DO (help
welcome)" starting around 2005-03-22.

NOTE: I'm affraid that very few people will bother filing bug reports to
the ALSA BTS for as long as this first requires creating a user account!

Every bug tracker in existence requires creating a user account first. 
It's just part of open source development these days, the volume is too
high to depend on mailing lists.  You should consider being able to report
bugs a privilege, try it with any other OS and see how far you get.

Anyway I'm not surprised that several of the drivers are broken.  I
believe tiwai wrote these based on the OSS driver without access to the
hardware.
