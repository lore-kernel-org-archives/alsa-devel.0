Summary:                    Audigy 4 (bulk, non-Pro) unsupported (patch
included)
Description: 
I recently bought me a Creative Audigy 4 and was surprised it didn't work
at all ... I noticed it wasn't detected and made it detectable and copied
the settings from Audigy 4 Pro. I have to click the "Audigy Analog/Digital
Output switch" switch to make it work. Front/Center, Mic works, however I
have no idea about wether SPDIF is ok or not (I have no devices). It might
be that a lot of functionality is missing still but it's a start.

First, output of "$ lspci -vn | grep -1 0401"
0000:02:09.0 0401: 1102:0008
        Subsystem: 1102:1021

Then, using "modprobe emu10k1 sumsystem=xxxxxx" does not work at all for
me, doesn't get the interrupt up and errors about probe failing.

So I added did this to my kernel sound/pci/emu10k1/emu10k1_main.c:

	{.vendor = 0x1102, .device = 0x0008, .subsystem = 0x10211102,
	 .driver = "Audigy2", .name = "Audigy 4 [A400?]", 
	 .id = "Audigy2",
	 .emu10k2_chip = 1,
	 .ca0102_chip = 1,
	 /*.ca0151_chip = 1, */
	 /*.spk71 = 1,	*/
	 /*.spdif_bug = 1,*/
	 .ac97_chip = 1} ,

I left those commented out as I've tried the options and noticed no
difference in operation. Also, I don't know the SB0xxx model (can't remove
the card and look at it at the moment either).

I can't seem to access this bugtracker at times ... the route seems to go
down often (nothing wrong on my side).

Ok I posted a bit prematurely, there seems to be more to it than just
ca0102_chip ... because ca0108_chip had been on in a previously loaded
module, it worked with just 102. However on a cold restart it did not. It
needs something from both 102 and 108?!?! I started testing by re-enabling
things. This loads perfectly:

	 .driver = "Audigy2", .name = "Audigy 4 [A400?]", 
	 .id = "Audigy2",
	 .emu10k2_chip = 1,
	 .ca0102_chip = 1,
	 .ca0108_chip = 1,
	 .ca0151_chip = 1,
	 .spk71 = 1,
	 /* .spdif_bug = 1, */
	 .ac97_chip = 1} ,

However, if the different chip ca's, 102 and 108 are actual chips this
seems like a bad idea, chanses are that it uses ca108 but needs something
from 102 to route the sound correctly ... but this way everyhting works
correctly from first load of the module so it's another step in the right
direction.

I think I have the same card, on mine you can read
Sound Blaster Audigy 4
