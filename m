Summary:                    Analog/Digital output not working.
Description: 
I've been unable to get my SB Live! to send analog pcm out through the
Analog/Digital port. It's connected through this port to my receiver, and
while AC3 over the digital port works fine, I can't get anything else to
go over the line. I have a 48kHz wave file I've been testing, and I've
tried playing it with aplay over hw0,0 (no good), hw0,1 (doesn't exist),
and hw0,2 (no effect). 

I have the master, IEC Coaxial, AC97, External amplifier, and SB Live
Analog/Digital Output Jack all either unmuted or set to max volume. I've
tried loading the snd_pcm_oss module with various snd_dsp_map settings
without success.

I've tried this on 1.0.7 and 1.0.8rc1. I dimly remember this working in
the past, so I don't know if this was broken in the upgrade to 1.0.7
(which I had to do because AC3 passthrough didn't work in the version that
came with the 2.6.9 kernel) or whether I have some strange
misconfiguration. Help is appreciated! Thanks!

Try to play with "IEC958 Optical Raw" switch.

I've tried the IEC Optical Raw switch, and it made no difference when it
was on or off.

So ALSA applications that let you specify the hardware device work fine,
the problem is with OSS apps that aren't having their output directed to
the digital out.. and I can't get any digital out if I specify a device in
the form hw=x,x, so I don't know what I could specify to snd_dsp_map for
the snd_pcm_oss module to redirect the sound that way. I guess my main
complaint is that for the emu10k1 driver, the "SB Live Analog/Digital
Output Jack" option doesn't seem to be doing anything.
