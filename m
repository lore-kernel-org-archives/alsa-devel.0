Summary:                    Headphone and Front Mic are switched
Description: 
I installed alsa-driver-1.0.9b.tar.bz2, and the back panel
assignments that I can test seem to be assigned properly.
However, there is some sound coming out of the front mike jack,
and input is accepted through the headphone jack. Since these
jacks work as expected with Windows XP, I suspect that they are
misassigned in the driver.
Hardware: RealTek ALC655 AC'97 with ALC880(D)

Please let me know if there is anything else that you need from
me.

Thank you, AG

Make sure you unloaded snd-page-alloc module before loading snd-hda-intel. 
alsasound init script doesn't unload it.

If you still have the similar error, take a look at kernel error messages.
 Usually you have unresolved symbols or errors there.

There seem to be mismatches in what I build, what should I build?
Here are the messages:
kernel: snd_pcm: disagrees about version of symbol snd_dma_reserve_buf
kernel: snd_pcm: disagrees about version of symbol snd_dma_free_pages
there are more of these!
My question is again, how do I get a coherent source set from which to
build?
I just did an update from the cvs sources.
