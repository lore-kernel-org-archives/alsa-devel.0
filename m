Summary:                    Headphone and Front Mic are switched
Description: 
I installed alsa-driver-1.0.9b.tar.bz2, and the back panel
assignments that I can test seem to be assigned properly.
However, there is some sound coming out of the front mike jack,
and input is accepted through the headphone jack. Since these
jacks work as expected with Windows XP, I suspect that they are
misassigned in the driver.
Hardware: RealTek ALC655 AC'97 with ALC880(D)

Please let me know if there is anything else that you need from
me.

Thank you, AG

OK, I found ALSA-Configuration.txt!
With model=5stack there are some improvements:
Back panel input to LineIN works as expected this way
Back panel input to Mic works as expected this way
but Front panel Mic still doesn't work, but input to front panel
Headphone accepts input and it shows under FrontMic on alsamixer
Back panel LineOut/speakers works as expected, shows as Front under
alsamixer
Back panel side-surround has stereo sound, shows as Surround under
alsamixer
Nothing shows on Back panel CenterSurround/Subwoofer,
Nothing shows on Back panel Rear-Surround

The problem is that your BIOS is incomplete, at least it doesn't initialize
the audio device properly.  So, we have to figure out the pin
configuration manually.

When you build the alsa-driver with --with-debug=full option, you can
choose model=test.  With this model, you can choose almost all possible
configuration for your device.  Note that the enum control can be changed
via alsamixer with up/down keys.
