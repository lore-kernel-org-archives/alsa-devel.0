Summary:                    Audigy2 Platinum: very low volume (both in and out)
Description: 
Both the input and output levels of my Audigy2 Platinum seem to be very low
if compared to the same card with Windows (win98se). For example, I
connected an external source (a MD player with very loud music in the
disc) to the optical input, then to the aux input, then to the aux2 input.
With the mixer settings to 100% the input level still does not go over
20-25% of the maximum amplitude (while with Windows I have to lower the
input level or it will be too high). The same thing applies to the output
level of my analog speakers. [I must be *very* careful when I reboot with
Windows and must not forget to turn the volume knob from 10 to 2]. I had
exactly the same problem when I used the emu10k1 drivers from sourceforge.

Known problem. The problem is due to the way sound is routed. This has been
fixed for one creative sound card so far. I will upload a patch to try
when I get a moment.

I went ahead and posted this note under another issue, but might as well
put it here too.  m not sure if this is relevant or not, but Im using FC5
kernel 2.6.17-1.2145_FC5 i686 and have lost sound from my Creative Labs
Audigy 2 ZS Platinum card completely. In earlier kernel builds (the
version that was shipped on the FC5 dvd) I had sound, but with my recent
update, I have lost it.
