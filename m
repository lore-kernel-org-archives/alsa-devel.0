Summary:                    Can not set recording source & twick line in =
volume
Description:=20
This problem is strange, because it does not appear in stock kernel 2.6.2
but it started to appear in later kernels, 2.6.3 up to 2.6.5 (and also in
alsa driver 1.0.4).

I am using both my PCI SB Audigy card and my on-board Intel AC'97
controller, with the modules snd-emu10k1 and snd-intel8x0. The onboard
card is wired to the line in of the SB card. WIth kernel 2.6.2 everything
works fine. I can hear the sound of the intel card through the SB card an=
d
also increase/decrease the line in volume of the SB card.

On later kernels, as well as alsa 1.0.4 I can not longer see the selectio=
n
of the "record source" for the SB, in ANY mixer. Moreover the default
input is the microphone (which is something I don't want to. The selectio=
n
of the "recording source" for the intel card does appear.

Also the volume slider for the microphone does not work. No matter what I
do, the volume remain constant. Of course I can controll it with other
means, but this is not the point.

03)

or (in -n mode)

And for what you need to set capture source ????
You only need to set capture volume.

If you want capture from analog sources (Line In, CD, Aux) set Analog Mix
Capture Volume
If you dont want hear Line In while capture set Analog Mix Playback Volum=
e
to 0

There are 2 Mic controls
Mic Playback Volume - controls playback volume
Mic Capture Volume - controls capture volume
