Summary:                    snd-ens1371 / es1938 Creative Ectiva silent playout
+ new line-in capture failure
Description: 
Soundcard: Creative Soundblaster PCI (Ectiva) Model:CT4730
Chip Label: Creative EV1938

Platform: Stable 2.4.24 Linux kernel on VIA MiniITX ME6000/M10000
          w/ multiple soundcards. ALSA compiled from source
          works with VIA motherboard Audio
          and some other Creative PCI soundcards. Need a stable ALSA
driver
          for this soundcard.

Problem:
The snd-ens1371 module loads correctly as 3rd sound device (First audio
device is VIA 8235 from motherboard, 2nd is PCSP).

Alsamixer -c 2 shows a reasonable set of
controls. Playout either with OSS emulation (play) or ALSA player
(aplay) plays WAV files but only silence for both 1.0.9 and 1.0.10rc1
releases.  
On ALSA 1.0.9 codebase,the Master Volume does not always show in
alsamixer. 
In 1.0.10rc1 it does always show.
ALSO:
  On ALSA 1.0.9 code, the Line-In capture works under both OSS Emulation
and with ALSA arecord.
On the latest development release ALSA 1.0.10rc1, the Line-In
capture no longer works. So a new problem has been introduced from .9 to
.10.


Other info:
Native OSS driver es1371 works fine with this card. But I want to switch
to ALSA.

Earlier model Creative PCI128, Model CT4750 loads snd-ens1371 and
works fine with both tested ALSA releases using same platform
configuration.

Audigy 2 Value also works fine using snd-emu10k1 with same configuration
(I included this card info to rule out basic config problems).

Q.Do your CT4750 have 4 channels codec ?
Q. Do your CT4730 have 2 channels codec ?

Raymond,
I only have the CT4730.
How would I know if it has a 2 channel codec?

If your sound card support 4 channels, it usually has 4 color jacks :-
green,pink,blue and black jacks

It seem that your sound card have STAC970x stereo codec but
snd_ens1371_codec_read() unable to read correct value

Add two printk statements as described in
https://bugtrack.alsa-project.org/alsa-bug/view.php?id=2132#10150 to trace the
read/write of codec registers 

Do you really have 3 ALSA sound drivers ?
