Summary:                    xmms/beep "couldn't open audio" on song change
Description: 
When playing a song in beep sometimes it'll pop up a "couldn't open audio"
box as if the device is in use. This is using dmix, however, so that
seemed a bit weird. I normally have to close and reopen beep to resolve
this. I believe xmms does the same thing because I've read about people
having the exact same issue with xmms.

This starts showing up when I start pressing play again:

ALSA lib pcm_direct.c:196:(make_local_socket) connect failed:
/tmp/alsa-dmix-30443-1118514847-814284: Connection refused
ALSA lib pcm_dmix.c:834:(snd_pcm_dmix_open) unable to connect client

ALSA lib pcm_direct.c:196:(make_local_socket) connect failed:

ALSA lib pcm_dmix.c:834:(snd_pcm_dmix_open) unable to connect client
ALSA lib pcm_direct.c:196:(make_local_socket) connect failed:
/tmp/alsa-dmix-30443-1118514847-814284: No such file or directory
ALSA lib pcm_dmix.c:834:(snd_pcm_dmix_open) unable to connect client
ALSA lib pcm_direct.c:196:(make_local_socket) connect failed:
/tmp/alsa-dmix-30443-1118514847-814284: No such file or directory


However one thing which I've never seen mentioned in the previous reports,
is that when trying to use another app through dmix it doesn't work
either. Here's what mplayer says, when trying to play a video:

alsa-init: 1 soundcard found, using: default
ALSA lib pcm_direct.c:196:(make_local_socket) connect failed:
/tmp/alsa-dmix-30443-1118514847-814284: No such file or directory
ALSA lib pcm_dmix.c:834:(snd_pcm_dmix_open) unable to connect client
alsa-init: playback open error: No such file or directory
Could not open/initialize audio device -> no sound.
Audio: no sound

so apparently something went wrong with /tmp/alsa-dmix-*. As soon as I
closed beep, all other applications started working properly again, and
when I start it back up again, it works fine again too, until it does this
again. It seems to do it sporadically so it's somewhat hard to test for.

Attached is my asoundrc.
