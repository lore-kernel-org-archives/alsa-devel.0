The patch

   ASoC: codec: hdac_hdmi: fix pin connections at cvt enable

has been applied to the asoc tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/sound.git for-5.2

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: codec: hdac_hdmi: fix pin connections at cvt enable

In display codecs supported by hdac_hdmi, the connection indices are
shared by all converters. At boot and resume from suspend,
the connection state may be reset to default values.

In case of multiple connected pins (multiple monitors connected
with audio capability), routing and mute status of pins that
are not connected to any PCM, may interfere with other pins.
E.g. after resume from S3 with multiple monitors, unless
all converters are in active use, playback to some PCMs may
be muted due to the default settings of unrelated converters.

Avoid this by ensuring all pin:cvt selections are correct
in codec whenever a converter is enabled for playback.
