Hi,

Which is the best way to restart an PCM device.
If i use a snd_pcm_close() and snd_pcm_open()

snd_pcm_open() fails with -16 {device or resource buzzy} error value
even snd_pcm_close() is sucessfull.

Is it because i am not draining or droping frames before snd_pcm_close ??


Please tell me the best way to restart a PCM device

Thanks and regards
Irfan
