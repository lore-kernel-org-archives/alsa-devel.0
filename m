Summary:                    Choppy sound using default dmix config for some
applications but not others.
Description: 
As reported in http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-457951.html
alsa 1.0.11 causes skipping sound in some applications but not others.

Sound skips in rhytymbox and totem, but not xmms, realplayer, or mplayer.

This occurs with default dmix setup (i.e. with no .asoundrc).  Creating an
.asoundrc like this causes the skipping to stop for those applications
that skip.

pcm.!default {
  type hw
  card 0
}

This has been reported using the cmipci driver, the Intel ICH4 driver, the
i915GM driver, and on a ppc iBook G4.

On user reports that fiddling with the .asoundrc parameters can lessen the
problem, but not eliminate the problem.

I would like to add my own experience with this issue.

I had this problem before, and was able to work around it by increasing
period_size and buffer_size. As they got larger, skipping reduced, until
finally there was no skipping at 8192 period_size and 16384 buffer_size.

This time around, there is still choppiness at those values, and I cannot
make them any larger. Also, it wasn't a very pleasant workaround, as it
added a lot of latency.

My card is an ess1371. If there's anything I can do to help as far as
troubleshooting--debug kernels, you name it--please let me know.
