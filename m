Summary:                    Random beeps, ticks and clicks
Description: 
Below is what i posted to the gentoo-forums without getting without getting
help that solved any of my problems.

I have a problem with alsa and my SBLive-card and kernels newer than
2.4.19.
All in all it works without error-messages and the sound is pretty nice
etc.
But every now and then the music i listen to is interrupted for a small
period of time (around 0.5s most of the time) and during this time i can't
type or move the mouse and an annoying beep comes from my speakers. I am
pretty sure that it is some sort of interruption because the few times the
interrupts are long i am sure that the music continues from where it were
and also, as i said above, i can't type etc during this small period.
This seems to happen more during heavy load than under normal load but it
still happens a lot at any given time. 
---
This problem happened with these kernels:
vanilla-sources-2.4.20
vanilla-sources-2.4.28
gentoo-sources-2.4.20
gentoo-sources-2.4.26-r12
gentoo-dev-sources-2.6.9-r4

(gentoo-sources are gentoo's own patchsets)

Anyway. Since i posted this i've realized that the beeps (and sometimes
also clicks/ticks) also happen more frequent during high network-load and
not only normal load.
Especially the clicking and ticking noise appear more frequent when
downloading large amount of data with high transfer-rates.

I changed the setting in BIOS, setting IRQ 11 to "reserved". I am not sure
what that meant but now eth0 is on IRQ 10 instead of sharing with emu10k1
which is good i guess.
However that did not help me at all since the random beeps are still there
:(

Can you provide a detailed hardware description including the motherboard
chipset?   Is this an AMD64 or VIA KT266 based system?  There is a very
similar, long standing bug report in the kX forums (Windows driver for
emu10k*).  This was never really solved and the consensus seems to be
buggy hardware.

Maybe you have an extreme PCI latency setting or something.
