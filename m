Summary:                    snd-ice1724 outputs white noise on rear surround
output of Chaintech AV-710
Description: 
A little background. The Chaintech AV-710 soundcard is a 7.1 soundcard
which uses this driver. It has two DACs. There's a standard DAC that
drives the first six channels. The rear surround channels, however, are
driven by a high-quality Wolfson DAC. Audio enthusiasts like to set the
card to drive the main two channels through this DAC instead in order to
get a very high quality stereo line-level output. The card's Windows
driver has an option to do just this, and in the past people have been
successful doing it on Linux. I am attaching an asound.state file which
owners of this card used with ALSA 1.0.7 to achieve this. However, I am
having trouble getting this to work with ALSA 1.0.8. The rear surround
output just produces white noise all the time. This is the case both with
this asound.state loaded and also with default levels (i.e., what I get if
I wipe /etc/asound.state and re-run alsaconf). It'd be nice to know what
changed between 1.0.7 and 1.0.8 that caused this to break, and how to fix
it. Thanks!

Actually, now it's OK, I just had to use the asound.state from this thread
but delete control 7 from it (ALSA kept complaining about it, probably
because I compiled driver 1.0.8 but I still have libs and tools 1.0.9rc).
Now it works fine :). As soon as this patch is merged, I consider it
fixed. Thanks a lot! Mmm...Wolfson...

Does the chaintech AV-710 have the same subvendor ID with AMP AUDIO2000?
It's weird...
