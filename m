The patch

   ASoC: dapm: Fix potential DAI widget pointer deref when linking DAIs

has been applied to the asoc tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/sound.git 

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: dapm: Fix potential DAI widget pointer deref when
 linking DAIs

Sometime a component or topology may configure a DAI widget with no
private data leading to a dev_dbg() dereferencne of this data.

Fix this to check for non NULL private data and let users know if widget
is missing DAI.
