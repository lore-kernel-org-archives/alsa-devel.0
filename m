Summary:                    No sound output  despite unmuting and maximizing all
volume settings
Description: 
I get no sound output from any program I have tried (xmms, play, aplay, cat
> /dev/audio) with no error messages or any other indication that there is
a problem which would cause sound to not occur.

I have already run alsamixer many times and tried every combination of
muted and unmuted settings with all volumes maximized.  With no volume
settings muted, and all volume settings at maximum level, I still get no
sound.

Everything *looks* like it's working - output in the kernel log, xmms's
display, everything.  But I get no sound out of the built-in speaker or
the headphone jack.

I have tried the following:

* Default install of Fedora Core 3; it recognized the sound card and
installed module settings in /etc/modprobe.conf to load snd-intel8x0.  But
I never got any sound out of this default install no matter what I tried.

* Custom compiled the 2.6.9 kernel with no patches except the software
suspend 2 patch.  This built the version of the ALSA drivers that come
with 2.6.9.  Still no sound.

* Downloaded and compiled version 1.0.7 of the ALSA drivers and installed
them.  Still no sound.

Sorry, didn't know that. 

I was too happy (sort of) because somebody else had the same problem,
under the same conditions. That's why I reported here. (I tried cleaning
up a bit the Bug report page, but I couldn't remove my attachments).

Thanks.

The problem in this bug seems that some missing codec setup for STAC9752. 
Needs a more deeper look at the datasheet.
