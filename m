Summary:                    Sounc card is mute
Description: 
I have a Turtle Beach Santa Cruz. It worked perfectly with SuSE Linux 9.0
and still works perfectly under Windows XP. I "upgraded" to SuSE 9.2 and
the sound card is inoperative, mute, lifeless, sound-free. The only advice
I got from SuSE support was that I shouldn't have skipped from 9.0 to 9.2
without going thgrough 9.1 on the way. That sounds like pretty stupid
advice.
I have spent weeks twiddling with settings  recommended by member sof the
alsa users group, to no avail.

In YaST I set Master Playback, PCM and DAC at 100. Sound test produces
zilch.
As far as I can tell, no Mute check boxes in KAMix are checked except Mic.

The first thing to suspect for the silent output is the mixer
configuration.  Please attach /etc/asound.state for checking.

Also, make sure that the cable is connected to the correct jack.
