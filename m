Maybe because my paragraph doesn't state it clearly -- it's nothing
wrong with regmap caching write-only registers; but it caching data
registers would potentially cause dirty data or channel swap/shift.
So the reason (1) here is "cannot cached" == "should be volatile".

I will revise the commit message for review and fix the subject.

Thank you
