One more thing I think I have *found* using speaker test.
Under both 1.0.8 and 1.0.6 the LFE/CENTER and Rear Surround jacks seem to
be swapped.
Oddly enough in 1.0.6 Doom3 has correct surround, while in 1.0.8 it
doesn't work correctly.

Also, I forgot to mention my card is nVidia CK8 based.

nforce2 built in sound on an a7n8x-e deluxe motherboard
am also experiencing this issue on 2.6.10. Very frustrating, its a
showstopper on migration from windows to linux. Will attach
/etc/asound.state and /proc/asound/card0/codec97#0/* files tonight.
