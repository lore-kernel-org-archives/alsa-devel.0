Summary:                    (snd_)opl3sa2 (isa) doesn't work (fails on playback)
on 2.6.x kernels
Description: 
It doesn't work on all 2.6.x kernel I have tried (current 2.6.10)
alsaconf doesn't detect the card as PnP, and fails to find it with
bruteforce.

When module is loaded by hand it shows no error, but on `aplay samle.wav`
I got
"ALSA /work/install/alsa-driver-1.0.5a/alsa-kernel/core/pcm_lib.c:2172:
playback
write error (DMA or IRQ trouble?"

on boot with 2.4.x kernel, everything magically works (alsaconf, aplay
etc..)

the bug is reported 4 months ago on
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3117
that's why some versions are old (but I had tried alsa-1.0.8 before
reposting this bug here)

The alsaconf-isapnp-2.6.patch should fix the alsaconf probing problem.
Please, confirm.

Also, could you try remove 'options snd-opl3sa2' line from your
modprobe.conf and try the command 'modprobe snd-opl3sa2' on fresh system
(after boot)?

perex: Thanks for the patch! Unfortunately, I'm unable to get it to work.

The patch you attached to this bug appears to be against the CVS tree,
which won't even build for me. Furthermore, I've had trouble figuring out
how to apply the patch. I've tried 'patch -p1 < <patchfile>' from the
./alsa-utils/alsaconf directory, as well as 'patch -p0 < <patchfile>' and
-p1 says it can't find the file to patch. -p0 says that it looks like the
patch has already been applied.

What kernel are you running? I'm still on 2.6.12.2. 

If possible, a patch against ALSA 1.0.9 would be much appreciated.

Thanks!
