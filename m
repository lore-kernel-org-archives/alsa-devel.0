I think that my issue report # 902 describes the same problem, although I
have examined that it's the rear socket's channel second not working
regardless of mixer settings. Could anyone check if it's so?

Exact same problem here, right rear surround speaker doesn't work in a 4.0
setup with the "Line-in as Surround" option set.
Works fine with kernel 2.6.10, but 2.6.11 doesn't. Also tried plain alsa
release 1.0.8 and recent checkout from CVS. These also don't work.
asound.state the same in both cases (2.6.10 compared against the others),
also the ac97#0-0+regs only differs in some volume settings. But also
tested it by setting the exact same register settings.

System:
Asus A7N8X-X
Debian Unstable
Kernel 2.6.11-ck1
