The patch

   ASoC: dapm: Recalculate audio map forcely when card instantiated

has been applied to the asoc tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/sound.git 

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: dapm: Recalculate audio map forcely when card
 instantiated

Audio map are possible in wrong state before card->instantiated has
been set to true.  Imaging the following examples:

time 1: at the beginning

  in:-1    in:-1    in:-1    in:-1
 out:-1   out:-1   out:-1   out:-1
 SIGGEN        A        B      Spk

time 2: after someone called snd_soc_dapm_new_widgets()
(e.g. create_fill_widget_route_map() in sound/soc/codecs/hdac_hdmi.c)

   in:1     in:0     in:0     in:0
  out:0    out:0    out:0    out:1
 SIGGEN        A        B      Spk

time 3: routes added

   in:1     in:0     in:0     in:0
  out:0    out:0    out:0    out:1
 SIGGEN -----> A -----> B ---> Spk

In the end, the path should be powered on but it did not.  At time 3,
"in" of SIGGEN and "out" of Spk did not propagate to their neighbors
because snd_soc_dapm_add_path() will not invalidate the paths if
the card has not instantiated (i.e. card->instantiated is false).
To correct the state of audio map, recalculate the whole map forcely.
