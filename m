Summary:                    USB sound device appears to be loading properly, but
all applications report the device is busy
Description: 
I own a USB audio Device with a TI burr-brown DAC and with my recent
upgrade to 2.6.15-ck4, all apps report that the device is busy.  I found
this bug https://bugtrack.alsa-project.org/alsa-bug/view.php?id=1585 that
I thought might be the culprit, but when I tried to apply the patch, I
found that it was already applied.  I tried to reverse it, thinking that I
might have had one of the devices that worked without it and this patch
actually broke it, but no joy.

The device appears to be present as alsa device hw:1,0, the same as it
always was, and I can select it, but all apps report that it is busy or
blocked.  This all worked properly with a 2.6.14-ck kernel.

BTW, I chose block as the severity because the card does not work now, but
has with earlier kernels, so it is a regression.

Please make sure that you're using kernel 2.6.15.2 or later.
