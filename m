Summary:                    Can't record anything from MIC with Acer 1641
(ALC260)
Description: 
With the new hda drivers in CVS, the speakers and jack output works very
good.
But I can't record anything from the external mic or from the mic input.
I followed jwoithe advises : To record from the internal mic or the
external mic jack, you need to:

 * select the "mic" as the input source (displayed in "Playback" view)
 * in the "Mic Jack Mode" control, select "Mic bias 80pc"
 * in "Capture" view, unmute "Capture" channel (NOT "Capture 1") and
   turn its volume up.
Even after doing that, I can't record sound.
Nevertheless, when I unmute the "mic" channel in the alsamixer "playback",
i can hear sound from the mic but i cannot record it.
