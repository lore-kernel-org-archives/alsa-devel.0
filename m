Summary:                    USB sound device appears to be loading properly, but
all applications report the device is busy
Description: 
I own a USB audio Device with a TI burr-brown DAC and with my recent
upgrade to 2.6.15-ck4, all apps report that the device is busy.  I found
this bug https://bugtrack.alsa-project.org/alsa-bug/view.php?id=1585 that
I thought might be the culprit, but when I tried to apply the patch, I
found that it was already applied.  I tried to reverse it, thinking that I
might have had one of the devices that worked without it and this patch
actually broke it, but no joy.

The device appears to be present as alsa device hw:1,0, the same as it
always was, and I can select it, but all apps report that it is busy or
blocked.  This all worked properly with a 2.6.14-ck kernel.

Continuing to investigate so I can narrow it down for you, as I can imagine
you are quite busy, I find that the same patch that broke playback for the
other usb devices as reported in bug 1585 also broke playback for my
device.  

I determined this by taking my now working 2.6.15 kernel, and applied only
the commit entitled "start submitting URBs in the prepared state".  This
broke playback.  The fix applied in 2.6.15.2 did not fix it for this
device.  So I hope this is helpful and it can be fixed soon.

I am very happy as I have sound again.  I reversed the two commits against
2.6.15.4, the fix first and then the original "start submitting URBs in
the prepared state", and I have a working device.  So I have sound for the
time being, and a patch to apply against future kernels if necessary.  I
attach the patch for reference and for anybody else that might stumble
across this bug and need a fix before it is fixed in the kernel.

I am happy to provide any additional information about the device, or do
all manners of testing to help fix this in the driver permanently.
