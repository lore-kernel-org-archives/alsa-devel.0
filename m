Summary:                    Master volume control only controls front speakers
Description: 
The master volume control has no effect on the rear speakers.
The rear speakers can be controlled by "Sigmatel Surround" but not
completly muted.

I use "Sigmatel 4-Speaker Stereo" to get sound on all 4 speakers. The
speakers are plugged into both output plugs on the soundcard.

I tried all volume controls that are provided, there seems to be no master
control.

It's feature request. We haven't designed abstract mixer layer at the
moment,
but you are allowed to control fully hardware anyway. If you cannot mute
completely the rear speakers, then it's probably hardware problem.
