Summary:                    snd_hda_intel does not recognize acl880 sound chip
Description: 
I bought a Shuttle ST20G5 box. Sound doesn't get detected or
seem to work with manual load.

chipset:
  ATI Xpress 200 northbridge
  ULI 1573 southbridge

The documentation says the sound is:
  Realtek ALC880

alsaconf detects nothing
manually loading snd_hda_intel also doesn't print anything in the
log files; though it does seem to load all the snd stuff just fine.

It seems that the device has an unknown controller by ALI.

Try to add the corresponding PCI IDs (10b9:5461) to azx_ids[] in
pci/hda_intel.c, in case the chipset is compatible with Intel ICH6/7.

I did as you requested and added the PCI ID.

When the driver loads during boot all I get is
tons of "azx_get_response timeout" lines on my
console and I have to sysrq-b to reboot to a
different kernel.

I also got the 1.0.9rc4a source after trolling
the web and it does the exact same thing.

Any ideas on how to get this chip supported?
