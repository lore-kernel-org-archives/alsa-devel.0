This patch series bring ASoC up to version 0.13 as released here
yesterday :-

http://opensource.wolfsonmicro.com/~lg/asoc/

Significant Changes:-

 o Digital Audio Interface configuration is completely manual. This
makes machine/board drivers a little bigger, but makes debug and
workarounds a lot simpler.

 o Clocking is now entirely configured from the machine driver.

 o Digital Audio Interfaces now have an API for operations for setting
hardware format, clocking, masters, etc.

 o New codecs, platforms and machine supported. (will follow this
series)

Liam 

P.S. Changes to documentation will follow in a few days.
