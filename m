Summary:                    (snd_)opl3sa2 (isa) doesn't work (fails on playback)
on 2.6.x kernels
Description: 
It doesn't work on all 2.6.x kernel I have tried (current 2.6.10)
alsaconf doesn't detect the card as PnP, and fails to find it with
bruteforce.

When module is loaded by hand it shows no error, but on `aplay samle.wav`
I got
"ALSA /work/install/alsa-driver-1.0.5a/alsa-kernel/core/pcm_lib.c:2172:
playback
write error (DMA or IRQ trouble?"

on boot with 2.4.x kernel, everything magically works (alsaconf, aplay
etc..)

the bug is reported 4 months ago on
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3117
that's why some versions are old (but I had tried alsa-1.0.8 before
reposting this bug here)

I have recompiled and installed the latest versions of alsa-driver,
alsa-utils, and alsa-lib. I applied the above patch before compiling
alsa-utils and copied the above alsaconf script over the one installed by
alsa-utils.

No PnP cards were detected.

I have attached a tar.bz2 of my sys directory. If I need to pack it
differently, please let me know.

When I tried to do "modprobe snd_opl3sa2" after a reboot, I get a "FATAL"
error saying "No such device". In dmesg, I see that pnp
registers/unregisters the opl3sa2 driver.

Thanks.

Edit: I'll be attaching my /proc/asound as well, for fun.

The ISAPnP code in your kernel does not detected the ISAPnP card. Try
toggle the pnp system os option in your bios and repeat all tests. Also,
send me all pnp / PnP lines from dmesg (dmesg | grep -E "(pnp|PnP)") after
boot for both cases when the card is detected and when it is not.
