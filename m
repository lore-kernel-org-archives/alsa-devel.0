Summary:                    Driver cant find firmware for Layla24
Description: 
Hello,

After modprobe snd-layla24 ,
in dmesg|tail:

ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:0e.0[A] -> GSI 19 (level, low) -> IRQ 19
ALSA /usr/src/alsa-driver-1.0.9b/pci/echoaudio/echoaudio.c:41:
get_firmware(): Firmware not available (-2)
Echoaudio Layla24: probe of 0000:00:0e.0 failed with error -2

Same issue that another guy is experiencing with a Layla20:

The time, when I had to patch the alsa-driver tree and echo-drivers had his
own website, I could use the sound-layla20 without any major problem.
 Maybe this helps developpers to resolve the problem?

(Normally I should pick an old alsa-driver tree and patch it with an older
driver, but I can't the old patches anymore)

P.S. I'm the other guy that is experiencing the same problem

Well, at that time i wasnt able to compile them properly, probably because
of my little knowledge then regarding Linux.
Ow, pity Mr. Pochini isnt supporting them anymore as stated in ALSA matrix
:(
I hope we accomplish our goal by making gentle pressure both, and that a
well experienced coder will move ahead and help us out.
It's a real pain not being able to use such cards in this environment, as
in my opinion ALSA has got really powerful possibilities, such as using a
sound server(is it named like that?) like Jack and redirecting any program
i/o s the way you like. No need for plug-ins nor shit... Btw i'd like to
know your opinion regarding this and its usage if you have used it
before(which i guess is a yes?).
